Usage:
Install:                 C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Temp\sysmon.exe -i [<configfile>]
Update configuration:    C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Temp\sysmon.exe -c [<configfile>]
Install event manifest:  C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Temp\sysmon.exe -m
Print schema:            C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Temp\sysmon.exe -s
Uninstall:               C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\Temp\sysmon.exe -u [force]
  -c   Update configuration of an installed Sysmon driver or dump the
       current configuration if no other argument is provided. Optionally
       take a configuration file.
  -i   Install service and driver. Optionally take a configuration file.
  -m   Install the event manifest (done on service install as well).
  -s   Print configuration schema definition of the specified version.
       Specify 'all' to dump all schema versions (default is latest).
  -u   Uninstall service and driver. Adding force causes uninstall to proceed
       even when some components are not installed.

The service logs events immediately and the driver installs as a boot-start driver to capture activity from early in
the boot that the service will write to the event log when it starts.

On Vista and higher, events are stored in "Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Sysmon/Operational". On
older systems, events are written to the System event log.

Use the '-? config' command for configuration file documentation.More examples are available on the Sysinternals
website.

Specify -accepteula to automatically accept the EULA on installation, otherwise you will be interactively prompted to
accept it.

Neither install nor uninstall requires a reboot.
